<h1 style="text-align: center;">About Lost and Found Hub</h1> 
<p style="text-align: center;">The Lost and Found Hub is a 
    centralized online platform that offers a user-friendly experience 
    for campus students to effortlessly report and recover lost items,
     saving students time and stress while ensuring a safe and 
     dependable environment.  </p>

    <h2 style="text-align: center;">Proposed Solution</h2>
    <p>The Lost and Found Hub is a great place to allow students to come together 
        and recover their lost possessions.
         The platform would allow students to either report and/or claim
         missing items. It provides organization and coordination, 
         so that students can have immediate information whether their item
          has been found or not. There would no limitations in terms of 
          availability of items, operating hours, etc. 
        
    </p>
    <p>
        Students would be able to easily search for items and communicate
        with other students on the online platform. Students would not have
         to revisit the information desk or wait for a call back from the 
         staff for an update. The online platform would use automation to
         send notifications to the students once their items has been 
         found. This IT solution would be more efficient than using 
         traditional ways of claiming lost items across campus.
