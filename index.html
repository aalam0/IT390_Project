<p style="text-align: center;">The Lost and Found Hub is a 
    centralized online platform that offers a user-friendly experience 
    for campus students to effortlessly report and recover lost items,
     saving students time and stress while ensuring a safe and 
     dependable environment. </p>

    <h2 style="text-align: center;">Problem to Solve</h2>
    <p>Every year, students lose valuable items like headphones, laptops, personal items in places such as the library, 
        classrooms, food courts, etc. The process of recovering lost items is inefficient and time-consuming because most students
         are unaware of where to locate their items on campus. This is causes panic, stress, and wasted time for students who have
          no reliable source to look for their lost items on campus. 
    </p>
    <p>
        For instance, George Mason University has an information desk where students could potentially find their lost items; 
        however, students have no visibility of items and have limited access due to specific operating hours. Other issues
        include distance which can be inconvenient for students with busy schedules. It is also inefficient in terms of communication 
        because students would have to rely on reaching the staff at the information desk which can be difficult and busy at times. 
        In addition, the information desk does not accept certain items such as glasses, clothing, vehicle keys, earbuds, etc. 
        This is because the information desk has limited space; therefore. students would not be able to find such items that are 
        still considered valuable to them.
